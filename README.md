Concentration

Concentration is a Java game based off the game with the same name. The game allows users to reset the board, cheat and look at the solution, and undo any moves made. It also track the number of moves the player has made.

Concentration was made for the Rochester Institute of technology Computer Science for AP Students class. The project was meant as a test to my and my fellow students' abilities to create a graphical user interface and develop around the Model-View-Control system. The project was a lab for the class and merely went through one week of development.
